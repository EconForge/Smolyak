# Smolyak

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EconForge/Smolyak.png)](https://travis-ci.org/EconForge/Smolyak)

Efficient implementations of Smolyak's algorithm for function approxmation in Python and Julia.

Following Julia convention, the main Julia code is in the directory `src/` and the tests are in the directory `test/`.

Following Python convention, the main Python code is in the directory `smolyak/`.

Following both Julia and Python convention the documentation is found in the `doc/`. The goal of this project is to write a consistent and interface for both Python and Julia, which would allow us to have a single documentation suite. There may be cases where this is not possible, in which case any differences between the two implementations will be documented in separate files for each language.
