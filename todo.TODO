    ‚òê I noticed that for (40, 2) there are 10764961 points in B, but only 3090461 are non-zero. That is only 28.7085%. Maybe we should use sparse matrices. We should do some testing to see if that would help. @spencer @started(13-11-08 01:34)

      I don't know how to make the square, but imagine there is one at the beginning of this comment.  I agree that we should try some sparse matrices.  I think they will be faster.  @chase @commented(13-11-08)
